            Photography have not only been about freezing moments in time but
            about weaving stories through minute details, light, and
            composition. Recently, I started pursing a mini-project in which I
            aimed to capture three images of myself. Each photo has its own
            specific atmosphere and story – the viewer sees different parts of
            my nature. This is how the images were formed through my ideas and
            methods.

                The formal headshot serves to create a suitable professional
                image. It’s the type of photo that would make sense on a
                corporate website or a portfolio. This time, I chose a basic
                background, so as not to distract the viewers’ attention from
                me.

                    <b>Lighting:</b> For this particular image, I took on
                    natural light to avoid harsh shadows and as such, enhance
                    the appearance of my facial features. Natural light is ideal
                    for headshots as it eliminates shadows while accentuating
                    the intrepid structure’s contours.{' '}

                  <li>
                    <b>Lens choice:</b> In this image, I used a portrait lens
                    (55.0 - 250.0 mm) to produce shallow depth of field which
                    would blur the background slightly but keep my face crisp
                    and sharp. This focal length is preferred for portraits
                    since it focuses on the subject without distortion.

                  <li>
                    <b>Composition:</b> In this composition, I slightly adjusted
                    myself off the center of the camera such that my face, can
                    still be the main focus since it is a portrait. This
                    composition allows the viewers’ eyes to follow the subject
                    naturally while still keeping a certain equilibrium within
                    the frame.

                Stereotyping is almost inevitable when talking about the role of
                mothers. In this instance, I am no different. The photograph
                depicts my idea of beauty and my love for the surrounding
                greenery. Surrounded by a garden of grinning pink flowers, I
                donned a designer dress with a big rose in my hair. In my
                opinion, this picture is gentle, warm, and dreamy.

                    <b>Color Harmony:</b> It is worth noting that the color
                    scheme here was purposely matched. The pink rose in my hair
                    blends quite well with the background giving a rich
                    sensibility to the subject which is me and my environment.
                    Considering all this, don’t be surprised that I wore a dress
                    with pastel and earthy tones.

                  <li>
                    <b>Background Choice & Depth:</b> The origin of the theme
                    and a large number of pink flowers support the image with
                    the healthy sense of textures and layers. The bright image
                    of a pink blooming rose on the green leaves of the vine can
                    be beautiful and awe-inspiring as was the case with me. This
                    technique produces a soft layered dream-like quality to the
                    image.

                    <b>Natural Lighting:</b> This photo was taken outside with
                    natural light in the late afternoon. The sunlight was very
                    soft and well diffused as it didn’t create shadows and it
                    added a romantic softness to the picture. Instead, I looked
                    for a gentle light where I could avoid direct sunlight,
                    which is often too harsh and creates both highlights and
                    shadows. frame.

                    well as get inspired. The place is quite admirably done
                    which also speaks to my love for nature and my interest in
                    designing. Every piece of the puzzle was designed with care,
                    from the colors and the elements to the place itself, so
                    that the image would be calm and meek in all of its aspects.

                For this final shot, I wanted to capture my deep appreciation
                for art and the creative process. Set in an art gallery, this
                image reflects the inspiration I draw from historical works and
                the emotional depth embedded in each piece. I’m pictured with my
                back to the camera, gazing at a painting, creating a quiet,
                contemplative mood that mirrors my reverence for art.

                    <b>Setting & Props:</b> Choosing a gallery to host the art
                    was deliberate. Within a gallery space that embodies the
                    very soul of artistic inspiration, a space of contemplation
                    —literally and metaphorically. It reminds me of art, design,
                    and creativity. The paintings you put in the frame matter.
                    The portraits along the wall convey depth and reflection,
                    similar to how I seem both in posture and emotion in the
                    image. They contribute to narrative by insinuating the
                    concept of conversation; between viewer and work, but also
                    work and me as subject.

                  <li>
                    <b>Framing and Composition:</b> Framing myself, with my back
                    to the camera, looking at the paintings, creates an instant
                    identity of me as a viewer in that space. By suggesting the
                    viewer step into my shoes by asking -- how would they view
                    the something -- through my perspective, I hope to pique
                    curiosity/encouraging sympathetic inquiry. I positioned
                    myself a bit off the center, so that follows the he rule of
                    thirds and it creates a nice balance and a small movement of
                    dynamism to the photo. My presence takes priority in the
                    viewer eye, which then flows up to the paintings. The layout
                    establishes a flow of the work which translates to a
                    connection between me and the art, accentuating a
                    relationship between subject/setting.
